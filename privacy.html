            <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
            <p>SpreadsheetMemo ("I", "my" or "the app") is a flashcard-based learning web application developed by AntLightCode. This privacy policy explains how the app handles your information when you use the service.</p>

            <h3>2. Information Collected by the App</h3>
            <p><strong>SpreadsheetMemo app does not collect, store, or share any personal information.</strong></p>
            <p>SpreadsheetMemo operates entirely through Google's infrastructure and requires the following permissions to function:</p>

            </ul>

            <h3>3. How SpreadsheetMemo Uses Your Information</h3>
            <p>The app accesses your Google Sheets documents solely to:</p>

            </ul>
            <p><strong>All data remains in your Google Drive and is never transmitted to or stored on any servers.</strong></p>
